We tried to check it for security of vulnerability to make sure it's good. But you assume the risk and you should be reviewing the code yourself before you try to run it. And also sandboxing this so it doesn't have access to your whole operating system like using Docker to sandbox before you run it or use a virtual machine to sandbox it. and that we do not recommend running locally on your computer due to the risk of it having access to everything on your computer.\n\nUpdate or read me with a short paragraph overview/description at the top followed by a disclaimer section in red that points to the disclaimer file with the same disclaimer information.\n\nThen a section that lists out all the features of cool emojis.",
